WooCommerce Natural Sort for Products

== Description ==

*****************************************
THIS PLUGIN IS NO LONGER BEING DEVELOPED.
*****************************************


Sorts products alphabetically rather than asciibetically.


The issue with natural sort on Wordpress it needs to be performed at the SQL level not in Woocommerce.  The plugin installs a UDF into MySQL.

This plugin hasn't currently been tested on large numbers of products, so any constructive feedback would be appreciated.


Credit and thanks goes to @mooffie for sharing the UDF.


Tested with WooCommerce version 2.1.8
